# Full Stack Speech Therapist App

* **Work In progress**
  - For the next couple of weeks I will be updating this repo, *stay tuned* :soon:
  ## Working Features:  
    1. Search the database for a patient (type letter 'a' or 'b' into search field)
    2. Click on the patient from a list of patients all beginning with that letter
    3. add photos to that patient's profile
    4. add notes and mark them private or Public(can be seen by any user)
    5. log in, signup, and logout
    6. add new patients to the database
    7. progress page to view each patients progress (chart)
  ## Coming Soon:
    1. send messages to other therapist within the community  
    2. send quick progress reports to enrolled parents(via text)
    3. add a parents only login page (guardian, etc, that will only display their children information)
    4. More cohesive styling !
